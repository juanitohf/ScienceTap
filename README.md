ScienceTap
==========

ScienceTap is a versatile app to help both citizen scientists and researchers collect data in the field and lab. Initially designed to automate data entry for monitoring stream health, it can also be applied to collect data in a variety of field and lab settings using forms designed for each project. Users are assigned to a team depending on the type of data/ form they need to use. ScienceTap compiles the data for easy download and user viewing on the web. In addition there is a crowd sourcing form that lets non-members contribute data. Need a new form? Contact the developers to find out how you can join the ScienceTap revolution in automated data collection.  This app was designed and developed by Juan Huertas-Fernandez &amp; Victoria Styner (computer science students at Temple University) under the supervision of Dr Justin Shi (Computer Science) and Dr Laura Toran (Earth and Environmental Science). Funding was provided by several research projects including the National Science Foundation (grant), the William Penn Foundation, and the EPA
